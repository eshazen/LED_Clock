# LED Clock

Yet another LED clock.  ICM7218A drivers for 384 LEDs in a nice pattern.
20 pin header for power/signal.  Could be tested with e.g. Arduino.

Consider putting header somewhere for ESP32 or other WiFi capable MCU.

* `LED_Clock` is the working design.
* `LED_Clock_display` and `LED_Clock_logic` are another idea with separate Z80 board
